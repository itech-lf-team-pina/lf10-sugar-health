    <h3>
      Why should I track my sugar intake?
    </h3>
    <p class="text">
      A lot of the time we aren't aware of how much sugar we consume every day.
      Especially hidden sugar is a real danger for obesity, tooth decay or diabetes.
      Most adults eat about 95 gramms of sugar a day. The World health organisation (WHO) recommends only 25 gramms per
      day for an adult.
      The National health services in england (NHS) recommends no more than 19 gramms for children between the ages of 4-6
      years.

    <h3>
      What is hidden sugar?
    </h3>
    <p class="text">
      Hidden sugar is the kind of sugar that you aren't aware of.
      It is known to most, that fruit contains sugar, or that cake has sugar in it.
      But even frozen pizza, bread or ketchup contains sugar.
      We are here to help you keep track of all this sugar, hidden or otherwise.
